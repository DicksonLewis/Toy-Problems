Javascript knowledge sharpening (Code Challenge).

## Description

I have used my Javascript knowledge and skills to create:
  - Student Grade Generator that prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100, then output the correct grade.
  -Speed Detector program that takes as input the speed of a car which if it is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
  -Net Salary Calculator program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
